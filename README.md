# Intelligent Water Alerts
### Team Members: Hallie Nicholas, Adam Hungerford, Isaac Parada

**Project Description:**

Intelligent Water Alerts is a web application that will serve as a user interface for users, local mechanics, and donors of well systems in various countries, mostly in Africa, built by Messiah's Collaboratory Team. This app will enable the correct people to be notified when a well is not working as it should, allowing them to take action - whether that be going onsite to fix it or ordering parts. From this constant communication with the system, our goal is that these villages with well systems installed will have continuous access to running water no matter what may happen along the way.

3)  Type the command ```npm start```
4)  In the second terminal
5)  Navigate to the client directory: ```cd client```
6)  Type the command: ```npm start```

When you have finished the above steps, the application will spin up in a browser.

## Contributing to the UI:
- As you will notice, our application's file structure begins with two folders: **client** and **server**. Client contains everything in the frontend, and server is the backend which handles our database connection and all our api routes.
