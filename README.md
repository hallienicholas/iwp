**Project Description:**

Intelligent Water Alerts is a web application that will serve as a user interface for users, local mechanics, and donors of well systems in various countries, mostly in Africa, built by Messiah's Collaboratory Team. This app will enable the correct people to be notified when a well is not working as it should, allowing them to take action - whether that be going onsite to fix it or ordering parts. From this constant communication with the system, our goal is that these villages with well systems installed will have continuous access to running water no matter what may happen along the way.
